### Introduction

- To create a platform for students / companies
to register and create their own profile
- Companies can submit their vacant positions
for an employer or intern
- Recommendation system will provide push
notifications for students which will be based
on their profile
- College can verify students and also view
placement statistics on their dashboard

### Motivation

- In India students who are from less known colleges /
tier 3 colleges usually don't get equal job oppurtunities
- Students which are mostly from rural areas have lack of
real world experiences and practical knowledge
- Students are not aware of building impactful resume
College mostly use manual data collection during the
placements

### Proposed Solution

- We propose to develop a platform where students , companies and
colleges can register themselves for the purpose of jobs and
internship
- This system allows students to create a profile and search for
relevant jobs and internships
- Companies can post their job / internship vacancies for students
Students will be notified about job / internship vaccancies relevant
to their profile automatically
